The following was generated using the Standard Array Calculator by Aaron Hutchinson with the data:
   Vector Space Dimension: 3
           Code Dimension: 2
     Field Characteristic: 2
                    Basis: 100
                           010
                           
The standard array for this data is given below. The first row of the array is the code, generated by the given basis. The remaining columns are the cosets of the code in the vector space, with the minimal weight vector of each coset displayed in the leftmost column.

   000  010  100  110  
   001  011  101  111
